### Arduino security app

This is a personal project. The arduino acts like a server with some motion sensors, it communicates with the node server and provides security for houses. It can also send an SMS to the user when the alarm is triggered, it keeps track of the history, it also registers the temperature, and the alarm arms and disarms itself automatically as the user comes/goes away from home. All the information with graphs can be viewed in the client app as well/ it can be deployed outside the local network but a login system would be advised for that.
